          Dana is amazing at what she does!! We went into our plan with some small idea of what we wanted our kitchen remodel to look like, but Dana brought it to life!! We are overjoyed with the design and all of the specialty things she added. Her knowledge about cabinets/tile/countertops was fabulous and really helped in the guidance of our Beautiful new kitchen layout!! We highly recommend Dana Snyder!

          Dana helped us remodel our kitchen and we then carried that over to our living room. She was amazing! She helped us coordinate and order everything and gave us plenty of samples of every decision there was to be made!
