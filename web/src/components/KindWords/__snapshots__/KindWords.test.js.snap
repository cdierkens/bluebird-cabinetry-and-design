                Dana helped us remodel our kitchen and we then carried that over to our living room. She was amazing! She helped us coordinate and order everything and gave us plenty of samples of every decision there was to be made!

                Dana is amazing at what she does!! We went into our plan with some small idea of what we wanted our kitchen remodel to look like, but Dana brought it to life!! We are overjoyed with the design and all of the specialty things she added. Her knowledge about cabinets/tile/countertops was fabulous and really helped in the guidance of our Beautiful new kitchen layout!! We highly recommend Dana Snyder!

                I bought a home in the Mason area. It had a small kitchen with an awkward layout. Dana designed a beautiful kitchen for me. Maximizing every inch of storage, she made the space much more functional.

                Dana helped us with our basement bar area and we could not be more pleased. She designed a new layout and helped us pick all of the finishes. Her ideas and attention to detail by far exceeded the expectations we had for the space. I'm in love with how it turned out! We would highly recommend Dana!!
